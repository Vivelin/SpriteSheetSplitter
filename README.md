Animated GIF encoder library from http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/11505/NGif-Animated-GIF-Encoder-for-NET which is based on http://www.fmsware.com/stuff/gif.html but the codeproject person did a horrible job of porting it. On the other hand. a lovely person by the name of **avianbc** submitted a patch for the transparency and last few pixels bugs in the comments.
